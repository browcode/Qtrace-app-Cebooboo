## About the Project
PROJECT QTRACE DESCRIPTION

A slow and sad year it has been (2020). started out last january and is till flying along the wind. covid, yep, the global panedmic. not the first and wont be the last but while its still here, who knows how long it’ll last.

This is Qtrace a two-day hackathon innovation. This utilizes two technological methods, web and android application. Qtrace aims to drastically reduce the time and costs that it takes to generate valuable insights and actionable information from data in gathered in contact tracing (CT) systems, specifically the most prominent CT System, Written Forms.


How Qtrace flutter application was made
1.	Setting up an editor. For this particular project, we used Visual studio code for developing the QTrace Flutter application.

VS code link: Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined
2.	Install flutter and Dart Plugins. In VS Code, add the Flutter and Dart plugins by going to the Plugins panel or invoke the view > command pallet type in flutter ont the extensions search field and then click to install. Dart will also be installed since it is a requirement.
3.	On the CLI we typed in flutter doctor to see the current installation state of Flutter on our computer. There may be some problems upon installation, but errors were observable and can be solved easily. 
4.	After checking all of these, we made the very first foundation of our application. Creating the flutter project QTRACE.
5.	Before diving directly on the code, itself. We planned for the layout and functionalities of the app first. Noted it on Notion and developed a prototype on Figma.
6.	The planning phase was very essential for us to make this project successful.
7.	After prototyping in Figma and planning all the functionalities and purpose of the app. The real fun of developing the app began.
8.	It was a big challenge since we were tasked to do it for only 48hours (minus sleep).
9.	The flutter app was done by page. Developing and routing each page one after the other. 
10.	Some third-party dependencies were also used like string validator, hex color, firebase auth and firestore.
11.	Every dependency and asset that was used in the development was always linked and placed in the pubspec.yaml file. (This is was kinda hard to remember at first, but we still managed)
12.	The two-day marathon went on and we finished the UI of the app. We may not be able to tether the app on firebase but if given the time it’ll be running for a good cause.
13.	Also, our web app was running smoothly as expected.
